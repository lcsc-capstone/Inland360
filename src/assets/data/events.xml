        <title>Painted Rock Stars</title>
        <description>People around the country are painting rocks and hiding them, adding a touch of art and kindness to their environment. The creativity and skill of these artists is astounding, and Wenaha Gallery showcases the work of eight regional painted rock artists. With images ranging from a slice of cherry pie to acrylic pour – all on a substrate of rocks – the Rock Star Art Event is well worth seeing.</description>

        <title>Making an Impression: Daily Wear in Dayton 1890-1989</title>
        <description>The Dayton Historic Depot has a new exhibit ready for viewing.  This year, we will be sharing women’s clothing from the Depot’s Collection and from the Boldman House Collection.  The clothing is organized by time period, and is accompanied by foundation garments, hats, and purses, as well.  The exhibit provides some cultural information on each decade and a discussion on how the fashion changed during that time period.  As women’s roles transformed, their clothing necessarily did as well.The exhibit has been funded by grants from the Warren Foundation and the Pacific Power Foundation.  Additional artifacts have been loaned to us by Lorna Barth, Sylvia Beuhler, Christine Broughton, and Mary Luce.  We would like to thank all of them for helping create this fascinating exhibit. The Dayton Historic Depot is located at 222 E. Commercial Ave, in Dayton, WA, and is open from 11: 00 a.m. to 4: 00 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday.  We hope you come visit us soon!</description>

        <title>Biddadat Fly By Mini Tour</title>
        <description>Biddadats going on tour! Three happy-go-lucky boys, poking around on controllers, picking on strings, banging on drums: sounds like a little Biddadat. They are Seattle&#x27;s essence of neo-funk, combining the nostalgia of funk and blues with contemporary rock and electronica. If their silly attitudes don&#x27;t make you comfortable enough to shake it on that floor, the tunes will certainly fuel those moves.

        <title>Making an Impression: Daily Wear in Dayton 1890-1989</title>
        <description>The Dayton Historic Depot has a new exhibit ready for viewing.  This year, we will be sharing women’s clothing from the Depot’s Collection and from the Boldman House Collection.  The clothing is organized by time period, and is accompanied by foundation garments, hats, and purses, as well.  The exhibit provides some cultural information on each decade and a discussion on how the fashion changed during that time period.  As women’s roles transformed, their clothing necessarily did as well.The exhibit has been funded by grants from the Warren Foundation and the Pacific Power Foundation.  Additional artifacts have been loaned to us by Lorna Barth, Sylvia Beuhler, Christine Broughton, and Mary Luce.  We would like to thank all of them for helping create this fascinating exhibit. The Dayton Historic Depot is located at 222 E. Commercial Ave, in Dayton, WA, and is open from 11: 00 a.m. to 4: 00 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday.  We hope you come visit us soon!</description>

        <title>Biddadat Fly By Mini Tour</title>
        <description>Biddadats going on tour! Three happy-go-lucky boys, poking around on controllers, picking on strings, banging on drums: sounds like a little Biddadat. They are Seattle&#x27;s essence of neo-funk, combining the nostalgia of funk and blues with contemporary rock and electronica. If their silly attitudes don&#x27;t make you comfortable enough to shake it on that floor, the tunes will certainly fuel those moves.

        <title>Making an Impression: Daily Wear in Dayton 1890-1989</title>
        <description>The Dayton Historic Depot has a new exhibit ready for viewing.  This year, we will be sharing women’s clothing from the Depot’s Collection and from the Boldman House Collection.  The clothing is organized by time period, and is accompanied by foundation garments, hats, and purses, as well.  The exhibit provides some cultural information on each decade and a discussion on how the fashion changed during that time period.  As women’s roles transformed, their clothing necessarily did as well.The exhibit has been funded by grants from the Warren Foundation and the Pacific Power Foundation.  Additional artifacts have been loaned to us by Lorna Barth, Sylvia Beuhler, Christine Broughton, and Mary Luce.  We would like to thank all of them for helping create this fascinating exhibit. The Dayton Historic Depot is located at 222 E. Commercial Ave, in Dayton, WA, and is open from 11: 00 a.m. to 4: 00 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday.  We hope you come visit us soon!</description>

        <title>Biddadat Fly By Mini Tour</title>
        <description>Biddadats going on tour! Three happy-go-lucky boys, poking around on controllers, picking on strings, banging on drums: sounds like a little Biddadat. They are Seattle&#x27;s essence of neo-funk, combining the nostalgia of funk and blues with contemporary rock and electronica. If their silly attitudes don&#x27;t make you comfortable enough to shake it on that floor, the tunes will certainly fuel those moves.

        <description>People around the country are painting rocks and hiding them, adding a touch of art and kindness to their environment. The creativity and skill of these artists is astounding, and Wenaha Gallery showcases the work of eight regional painted rock artists. With images ranging from a slice of cherry pie to acrylic pour – all on a substrate of rocks – the Rock Star Art Event is well worth seeing.</description>

        <title>Making an Impression: Daily Wear in Dayton 1890-1989</title>
        <description>The Dayton Historic Depot has a new exhibit ready for viewing.  This year, we will be sharing women’s clothing from the Depot’s Collection and from the Boldman House Collection.  The clothing is organized by time period, and is accompanied by foundation garments, hats, and purses, as well.  The exhibit provides some cultural information on each decade and a discussion on how the fashion changed during that time period.  As women’s roles transformed, their clothing necessarily did as well.The exhibit has been funded by grants from the Warren Foundation and the Pacific Power Foundation.  Additional artifacts have been loaned to us by Lorna Barth, Sylvia Beuhler, Christine Broughton, and Mary Luce.  We would like to thank all of them for helping create this fascinating exhibit.

        <title>Biddadat Fly By Mini Tour</title>
        <description>Biddadats going on tour! Three happy-go-lucky boys, poking around on controllers, picking on strings, banging on drums: sounds like a little Biddadat. They are Seattle&#x27;s essence of neo-funk, combining the nostalgia of funk and blues with contemporary rock and electronica. If their silly attitudes don&#x27;t make you comfortable enough to shake it on that floor, the tunes will certainly fuel those moves.

        <title>Making an Impression: Daily Wear in Dayton 1890-1989</title>
        <description>The Dayton Historic Depot has a new exhibit ready for viewing.  This year, we will be sharing women’s clothing from the Depot’s Collection and from the Boldman House Collection.  The clothing is organized by time period, and is accompanied by foundation garments, hats, and purses, as well.  The exhibit provides some cultural information on each decade and a discussion on how the fashion changed during that time period.  As women’s roles transformed, their clothing necessarily did as well.The exhibit has been funded by grants from the Warren Foundation and the Pacific Power Foundation.  Additional artifacts have been loaned to us by Lorna Barth, Sylvia Beuhler, Christine Broughton, and Mary Luce.  We would like to thank all of them for helping create this fascinating exhibit. The Dayton Historic Depot is located at 222 E. Commercial Ave, in Dayton, WA, and is open from 11: 00 a.m. to 4: 00 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday.  We hope you come visit us soon!</description>

        <title>Biddadat Fly By Mini Tour</title>
        <description>Biddadats going on tour! Three happy-go-lucky boys, poking around on controllers, picking on strings, banging on drums: sounds like a little Biddadat. They are Seattle&#x27;s essence of neo-funk, combining the nostalgia of funk and blues with contemporary rock and electronica. If their silly attitudes don&#x27;t make you comfortable enough to shake it on that floor, the tunes will certainly fuel those moves.

        <title>Making an Impression: Daily Wear in Dayton 1890-1989</title>
        <description>The Dayton Historic Depot has a new exhibit ready for viewing.  This year, we will be sharing women’s clothing from the Depot’s Collection and from the Boldman House Collection.  The clothing is organized by time period, and is accompanied by foundation garments, hats, and purses, as well.  The exhibit provides some cultural information on each decade and a discussion on how the fashion changed during that time period.  As women’s roles transformed, their clothing necessarily did as well.The exhibit has been funded by grants from the Warren Foundation and the Pacific Power Foundation.  Additional artifacts have been loaned to us by Lorna Barth, Sylvia Beuhler, Christine Broughton, and Mary Luce.  We would like to thank all of them for helping create this fascinating exhibit. The Dayton Historic Depot is located at 222 E. Commercial Ave, in Dayton, WA, and is open from 11: 00 a.m. to 4: 00 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday.  We hope you come visit us soon!</description>

        <title>Biddadat Fly By Mini Tour</title>
        <description>Biddadats going on tour! Three happy-go-lucky boys, poking around on controllers, picking on strings, banging on drums: sounds like a little Biddadat. They are Seattle&#x27;s essence of neo-funk, combining the nostalgia of funk and blues with contemporary rock and electronica. If their silly attitudes don&#x27;t make you comfortable enough to shake it on that floor, the tunes will certainly fuel those moves.

Gilmore says her dreams don&#x27;t stop until she cuts, weld, braze, and shape the scraps into treasures.
As an artist her favorite genres include industrial art &amp; assemblage. Artist Contact: Shelly Gilmore sgilmore@turbonet.com.

        <title>Making an Impression: Daily Wear in Dayton 1890-1989</title>
        <description>The Dayton Historic Depot has a new exhibit ready for viewing.  This year, we will be sharing women’s clothing from the Depot’s Collection and from the Boldman House Collection.  The clothing is organized by time period, and is accompanied by foundation garments, hats, and purses, as well.  The exhibit provides some cultural information on each decade and a discussion on how the fashion changed during that time period.  As women’s roles transformed, their clothing necessarily did as well.The exhibit has been funded by grants from the Warren Foundation and the Pacific Power Foundation.  Additional artifacts have been loaned to us by Lorna Barth, Sylvia Beuhler, Christine Broughton, and Mary Luce.  We would like to thank all of them for helping create this fascinating exhibit. The Dayton Historic Depot is located at 222 E. Commercial Ave, in Dayton, WA, and is open from 11: 00 a.m. to 4: 00 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday.  We hope you come visit us soon!</description>

        <title>Biddadat Fly By Mini Tour</title>
        <description>Biddadats going on tour! Three happy-go-lucky boys, poking around on controllers, picking on strings, banging on drums: sounds like a little Biddadat. They are Seattle&#x27;s essence of neo-funk, combining the nostalgia of funk and blues with contemporary rock and electronica. If their silly attitudes don&#x27;t make you comfortable enough to shake it on that floor, the tunes will certainly fuel those moves.

        <description>People around the country are painting rocks and hiding them, adding a touch of art and kindness to their environment. The creativity and skill of these artists is astounding, and Wenaha Gallery showcases the work of eight regional painted rock artists.

        <title>Making an Impression: Daily Wear in Dayton 1890-1989</title>
        <description>The Dayton Historic Depot has a new exhibit ready for viewing.  This year, we will be sharing women’s clothing from the Depot’s Collection and from the Boldman House Collection.  The clothing is organized by time period, and is accompanied by foundation garments, hats, and purses, as well.  The exhibit provides some cultural information on each decade and a discussion on how the fashion changed during that time period.  As women’s roles transformed, their clothing necessarily did as well.The exhibit has been funded by grants from the Warren Foundation and the Pacific Power Foundation.  Additional artifacts have been loaned to us by Lorna Barth, Sylvia Beuhler, Christine Broughton, and Mary Luce.  We would like to thank all of them for helping create this fascinating exhibit. The Dayton Historic Depot is located at 222 E. Commercial Ave, in Dayton, WA, and is open from 11: 00 a.m. to 4: 00 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday.  We hope you come visit us soon!</description>

        <title>Biddadat Fly By Mini Tour</title>
        <description>Biddadats going on tour! Three happy-go-lucky boys, poking around on controllers, picking on strings, banging on drums: sounds like a little Biddadat. They are Seattle&#x27;s essence of neo-funk, combining the nostalgia of funk and blues with contemporary rock and electronica. If their silly attitudes don&#x27;t make you comfortable enough to shake it on that floor, the tunes will certainly fuel those moves.

        <title>Making an Impression: Daily Wear in Dayton 1890-1989</title>
        <description>The Dayton Historic Depot has a new exhibit ready for viewing.  This year, we will be sharing women’s clothing from the Depot’s Collection and from the Boldman House Collection.  The clothing is organized by time period, and is accompanied by foundation garments, hats, and purses, as well.  The exhibit provides some cultural information on each decade and a discussion on how the fashion changed during that time period.  As women’s roles transformed, their clothing necessarily did as well.The exhibit has been funded by grants from the Warren Foundation and the Pacific Power Foundation.  Additional artifacts have been loaned to us by Lorna Barth, Sylvia Beuhler, Christine Broughton, and Mary Luce.  We would like to thank all of them for helping create this fascinating exhibit. The Dayton Historic Depot is located at 222 E. Commercial Ave, in Dayton, WA, and is open from 11: 00 a.m. to 4: 00 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday.  We hope you come visit us soon!</description>

        <title>Biddadat Fly By Mini Tour</title>
        <description>Biddadats going on tour! Three happy-go-lucky boys, poking around on controllers, picking on strings, banging on drums: sounds like a little Biddadat. They are Seattle&#x27;s essence of neo-funk, combining the nostalgia of funk and blues with contemporary rock and electronica. If their silly attitudes don&#x27;t make you comfortable enough to shake it on that floor, the tunes will certainly fuel those moves.

        <title>Making an Impression: Daily Wear in Dayton 1890-1989</title>
        <description>The Dayton Historic Depot has a new exhibit ready for viewing.  This year, we will be sharing women’s clothing from the Depot’s Collection and from the Boldman House Collection.  The clothing is organized by time period, and is accompanied by foundation garments, hats, and purses, as well.  The exhibit provides some cultural information on each decade and a discussion on how the fashion changed during that time period.  As women’s roles transformed, their clothing necessarily did as well.The exhibit has been funded by grants from the Warren Foundation and the Pacific Power Foundation.  Additional artifacts have been loaned to us by Lorna Barth, Sylvia Beuhler, Christine Broughton, and Mary Luce.  We would like to thank all of them for helping create this fascinating exhibit. The Dayton Historic Depot is located at 222 E. Commercial Ave, in Dayton, WA, and is open from 11: 00 a.m. to 4: 00 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday.  We hope you come visit us soon!</description>

        <title>Biddadat Fly By Mini Tour</title>
        <description>Biddadats going on tour! Three happy-go-lucky boys, poking around on controllers, picking on strings, banging on drums: sounds like a little Biddadat. They are Seattle&#x27;s essence of neo-funk, combining the nostalgia of funk and blues with contemporary rock and electronica. If their silly attitudes don&#x27;t make you comfortable enough to shake it on that floor, the tunes will certainly fuel those moves.

With images ranging from a slice of cherry pie to acrylic pour – all on a substrate of rocks – the Rock Star Art Event is well worth seeing.</description>

        <title>Making an Impression: Daily Wear in Dayton 1890-1989</title>
        <description>The Dayton Historic Depot has a new exhibit ready for viewing.  This year, we will be sharing women’s clothing from the Depot’s Collection and from the Boldman House Collection.  The clothing is organized by time period, and is accompanied by foundation garments, hats, and purses, as well.  The exhibit provides some cultural information on each decade and a discussion on how the fashion changed during that time period.  As women’s roles transformed, their clothing necessarily did as well.The exhibit has been funded by grants from the Warren Foundation and the Pacific Power Foundation.  Additional artifacts have been loaned to us by Lorna Barth, Sylvia Beuhler, Christine Broughton, and Mary Luce.  We would like to thank all of them for helping create this fascinating exhibit. The Dayton Historic Depot is located at 222 E. Commercial Ave, in Dayton, WA, and is open from 11: 00 a.m. to 4: 00 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday.  We hope you come visit us soon!</description>

        <title>Biddadat Fly By Mini Tour</title>
        <description>Biddadats going on tour! Three happy-go-lucky boys, poking around on controllers, picking on strings, banging on drums: sounds like a little Biddadat. They are Seattle&#x27;s essence of neo-funk, combining the nostalgia of funk and blues with contemporary rock and electronica. If their silly attitudes don&#x27;t make you comfortable enough to shake it on that floor, the tunes will certainly fuel those moves.

        <title>Making an Impression: Daily Wear in Dayton 1890-1989</title>
        <description>The Dayton Historic Depot has a new exhibit ready for viewing.  This year, we will be sharing women’s clothing from the Depot’s Collection and from the Boldman House Collection.  The clothing is organized by time period, and is accompanied by foundation garments, hats, and purses, as well.  The exhibit provides some cultural information on each decade and a discussion on how the fashion changed during that time period.  As women’s roles transformed, their clothing necessarily did as well.The exhibit has been funded by grants from the Warren Foundation and the Pacific Power Foundation.  Additional artifacts have been loaned to us by Lorna Barth, Sylvia Beuhler, Christine Broughton, and Mary Luce.  We would like to thank all of them for helping create this fascinating exhibit. The Dayton Historic Depot is located at 222 E. Commercial Ave, in Dayton, WA, and is open from 11: 00 a.m. to 4: 00 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday.  We hope you come visit us soon!</description>

        <title>Biddadat Fly By Mini Tour</title>
        <description>Biddadats going on tour! Three happy-go-lucky boys, poking around on controllers, picking on strings, banging on drums: sounds like a little Biddadat. They are Seattle&#x27;s essence of neo-funk, combining the nostalgia of funk and blues with contemporary rock and electronica. If their silly attitudes don&#x27;t make you comfortable enough to shake it on that floor, the tunes will certainly fuel those moves.

        <description>The Dayton Historic Depot has a new exhibit ready for viewing.  This year, we will be sharing women’s clothing from the Depot’s Collection and from the Boldman House Collection.  The clothing is organized by time period, and is accompanied by foundation garments, hats, and purses, as well.  The exhibit provides some cultural information on each decade and a discussion on how the fashion changed during that time period.  As women’s roles transformed, their clothing necessarily did as well.The exhibit has been funded by grants from the Warren Foundation and the Pacific Power Foundation.  Additional artifacts have been loaned to us by Lorna Barth, Sylvia Beuhler, Christine Broughton, and Mary Luce.  We would like to thank all of them for helping create this fascinating exhibit. The Dayton Historic Depot is located at 222 E. Commercial Ave, in Dayton, WA, and is open from 11: 00 a.m. to 4: 00 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday.  We hope you come visit us soon!</description>

        <title>Biddadat Fly By Mini Tour</title>
        <description>Biddadats going on tour! Three happy-go-lucky boys, poking around on controllers, picking on strings, banging on drums: sounds like a little Biddadat. They are Seattle&#x27;s essence of neo-funk, combining the nostalgia of funk and blues with contemporary rock and electronica. If their silly attitudes don&#x27;t make you comfortable enough to shake it on that floor, the tunes will certainly fuel those moves.

The creativity and skill of these artists is astounding, and Wenaha Gallery showcases the work of eight regional painted rock artists. With images ranging from a slice of cherry pie to acrylic pour – all on a substrate of rocks – the Rock Star Art Event is well worth seeing.</description>

        <title>Biddadat Fly By Mini Tour</title>
        <description>Biddadats going on tour! Three happy-go-lucky boys, poking around on controllers, picking on strings, banging on drums: sounds like a little Biddadat. They are Seattle&#x27;s essence of neo-funk, combining the nostalgia of funk and blues with contemporary rock and electronica. If their silly attitudes don&#x27;t make you comfortable enough to shake it on that floor, the tunes will certainly fuel those moves.

        <title>Painted Rock Stars</title>
        <description>People around the country are painting rocks and hiding them, adding a touch of art and kindness to their environment. The creativity and skill of these artists is astounding, and Wenaha Gallery showcases the work of eight regional painted rock artists. With images ranging from a slice of cherry pie to acrylic pour – all on a substrate of rocks – the Rock Star Art Event is well worth seeing.</description>
