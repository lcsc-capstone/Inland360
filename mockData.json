This year, we will be sharing women’s clothing from the Depot’s Collection and from the Boldman House Collection.  The clothing is organized by time period, and is accompanied by foundation garments, hats, and purses, as well.  The exhibit provides some cultural information on each decade and a discussion on how the fashion changed during that time period.  As women’s roles transformed, their clothing necessarily did as well.The exhibit has been funded by grants from the Warren Foundation and the Pacific Power Foundation.  Additional artifacts have been loaned to us by Lorna Barth, Sylvia Beuhler, Christine Broughton, and Mary Luce.  We would like to thank all of them for helping create this fascinating exhibit. The Dayton Historic Depot is located at 222 E. Commercial Ave, in Dayton, WA, and is open from 11: 00 a.m. to 4: 00 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday.  We hope you come visit us soon!",

Gilmore lives and creates in beautiful northern Idaho.\nWhen Gilmore stumbles upon parts and rusted old pieces, most people just think it’s junk or ready for the recycle bin. For Gilmore, projects pop into her mind….maybe a chicken, a whirly gig, or lately beasts. \nGilmore says her dreams don't stop until she cuts, weld, braze, and shape the scraps into treasures.\nAs an artist her favorite genres include industrial art & assemblage.

This year, we will be sharing women’s clothing from the Depot’s Collection and from the Boldman House Collection.  The clothing is organized by time period, and is accompanied by foundation garments, hats, and purses, as well.  The exhibit provides some cultural information on each decade and a discussion on how the fashion changed during that time period.  As women’s roles transformed, their clothing necessarily did as well.The exhibit has been funded by grants from the Warren Foundation and the Pacific Power Foundation.  Additional artifacts have been loaned to us by Lorna Barth, Sylvia Beuhler, Christine Broughton, and Mary Luce.  We would like to thank all of them for helping create this fascinating exhibit. The Dayton Historic Depot is located at 222 E. Commercial Ave, in Dayton, WA, and is open from 11: 00 a.m. to 4: 00 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday.  We hope you come visit us soon!",

This year, we will be sharing women’s clothing from the Depot’s Collection and from the Boldman House Collection.  The clothing is organized by time period, and is accompanied by foundation garments, hats, and purses, as well.  The exhibit provides some cultural information on each decade and a discussion on how the fashion changed during that time period.  As women’s roles transformed, their clothing necessarily did as well.The exhibit has been funded by grants from the Warren Foundation and the Pacific Power Foundation.  Additional artifacts have been loaned to us by Lorna Barth, Sylvia Beuhler, Christine Broughton, and Mary Luce.  We would like to thank all of them for helping create this fascinating exhibit. The Dayton Historic Depot is located at 222 E. Commercial Ave, in Dayton, WA, and is open from 11: 00 a.m. to 4: 00 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday.  We hope you come visit us soon!",

This year, we will be sharing women’s clothing from the Depot’s Collection and from the Boldman House Collection.  The clothing is organized by time period, and is accompanied by foundation garments, hats, and purses, as well.  The exhibit provides some cultural information on each decade and a discussion on how the fashion changed during that time period.  As women’s roles transformed, their clothing necessarily did as well.The exhibit has been funded by grants from the Warren Foundation and the Pacific Power Foundation.  Additional artifacts have been loaned to us by Lorna Barth, Sylvia Beuhler, Christine Broughton, and Mary Luce.  We would like to thank all of them for helping create this fascinating exhibit. The Dayton Historic Depot is located at 222 E. Commercial Ave, in Dayton, WA, and is open from 11: 00 a.m. to 4: 00 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday.  We hope you come visit us soon!",

This year, we will be sharing women’s clothing from the Depot’s Collection and from the Boldman House Collection.  The clothing is organized by time period, and is accompanied by foundation garments, hats, and purses, as well.  The exhibit provides some cultural information on each decade and a discussion on how the fashion changed during that time period.  As women’s roles transformed, their clothing necessarily did as well.The exhibit has been funded by grants from the Warren Foundation and the Pacific Power Foundation.

This year, we will be sharing women’s clothing from the Depot’s Collection and from the Boldman House Collection.  The clothing is organized by time period, and is accompanied by foundation garments, hats, and purses, as well.  The exhibit provides some cultural information on each decade and a discussion on how the fashion changed during that time period.  As women’s roles transformed, their clothing necessarily did as well.The exhibit has been funded by grants from the Warren Foundation and the Pacific Power Foundation.  Additional artifacts have been loaned to us by Lorna Barth, Sylvia Beuhler, Christine Broughton, and Mary Luce.  We would like to thank all of them for helping create this fascinating exhibit. The Dayton Historic Depot is located at 222 E. Commercial Ave, in Dayton, WA, and is open from 11: 00 a.m. to 4: 00 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday.  We hope you come visit us soon!",

This year, we will be sharing women’s clothing from the Depot’s Collection and from the Boldman House Collection.  The clothing is organized by time period, and is accompanied by foundation garments, hats, and purses, as well.  The exhibit provides some cultural information on each decade and a discussion on how the fashion changed during that time period.  As women’s roles transformed, their clothing necessarily did as well.The exhibit has been funded by grants from the Warren Foundation and the Pacific Power Foundation.  Additional artifacts have been loaned to us by Lorna Barth, Sylvia Beuhler, Christine Broughton, and Mary Luce.  We would like to thank all of them for helping create this fascinating exhibit. The Dayton Historic Depot is located at 222 E. Commercial Ave, in Dayton, WA, and is open from 11: 00 a.m. to 4: 00 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday.  We hope you come visit us soon!",

This year, we will be sharing women’s clothing from the Depot’s Collection and from the Boldman House Collection.  The clothing is organized by time period, and is accompanied by foundation garments, hats, and purses, as well.  The exhibit provides some cultural information on each decade and a discussion on how the fashion changed during that time period.  As women’s roles transformed, their clothing necessarily did as well.The exhibit has been funded by grants from the Warren Foundation and the Pacific Power Foundation.  Additional artifacts have been loaned to us by Lorna Barth, Sylvia Beuhler, Christine Broughton, and Mary Luce.  We would like to thank all of them for helping create this fascinating exhibit. The Dayton Historic Depot is located at 222 E. Commercial Ave, in Dayton, WA, and is open from 11: 00 a.m. to 4: 00 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday.  We hope you come visit us soon!",

This year, we will be sharing women’s clothing from the Depot’s Collection and from the Boldman House Collection.  The clothing is organized by time period, and is accompanied by foundation garments, hats, and purses, as well.  The exhibit provides some cultural information on each decade and a discussion on how the fashion changed during that time period.  As women’s roles transformed, their clothing necessarily did as well.The exhibit has been funded by grants from the Warren Foundation and the Pacific Power Foundation.  Additional artifacts have been loaned to us by Lorna Barth, Sylvia Beuhler, Christine Broughton, and Mary Luce.  We would like to thank all of them for helping create this fascinating exhibit. The Dayton Historic Depot is located at 222 E. Commercial Ave, in Dayton, WA, and is open from 11: 00 a.m. to 4: 00 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday.  We hope you come visit us soon!",

This year, we will be sharing women’s clothing from the Depot’s Collection and from the Boldman House Collection.  The clothing is organized by time period, and is accompanied by foundation garments, hats, and purses, as well.  The exhibit provides some cultural information on each decade and a discussion on how the fashion changed during that time period.  As women’s roles transformed, their clothing necessarily did as well.The exhibit has been funded by grants from the Warren Foundation and the Pacific Power Foundation.  Additional artifacts have been loaned to us by Lorna Barth, Sylvia Beuhler, Christine Broughton, and Mary Luce.  We would like to thank all of them for helping create this fascinating exhibit. The Dayton Historic Depot is located at 222 E. Commercial Ave, in Dayton, WA, and is open from 11: 00 a.m. to 4: 00 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday.  We hope you come visit us soon!",

This year, we will be sharing women’s clothing from the Depot’s Collection and from the Boldman House Collection.  The clothing is organized by time period, and is accompanied by foundation garments, hats, and purses, as well.  The exhibit provides some cultural information on each decade and a discussion on how the fashion changed during that time period.  As women’s roles transformed, their clothing necessarily did as well.The exhibit has been funded by grants from the Warren Foundation and the Pacific Power Foundation.  Additional artifacts have been loaned to us by Lorna Barth, Sylvia Beuhler, Christine Broughton, and Mary Luce.  We would like to thank all of them for helping create this fascinating exhibit. The Dayton Historic Depot is located at 222 E. Commercial Ave, in Dayton, WA, and is open from 11: 00 a.m. to 4: 00 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday.  We hope you come visit us soon!",

This year, we will be sharing women’s clothing from the Depot’s Collection and from the Boldman House Collection.  The clothing is organized by time period, and is accompanied by foundation garments, hats, and purses, as well.  The exhibit provides some cultural information on each decade and a discussion on how the fashion changed during that time period.  As women’s roles transformed, their clothing necessarily did as well.The exhibit has been funded by grants from the Warren Foundation and the Pacific Power Foundation.  Additional artifacts have been loaned to us by Lorna Barth, Sylvia Beuhler, Christine Broughton, and Mary Luce.  We would like to thank all of them for helping create this fascinating exhibit. The Dayton Historic Depot is located at 222 E. Commercial Ave, in Dayton, WA, and is open from 11: 00 a.m. to 4: 00 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday.  We hope you come visit us soon!",

This year, we will be sharing women’s clothing from the Depot’s Collection and from the Boldman House Collection.  The clothing is organized by time period, and is accompanied by foundation garments, hats, and purses, as well.  The exhibit provides some cultural information on each decade and a discussion on how the fashion changed during that time period.  As women’s roles transformed, their clothing necessarily did as well.The exhibit has been funded by grants from the Warren Foundation and the Pacific Power Foundation.  Additional artifacts have been loaned to us by Lorna Barth, Sylvia Beuhler, Christine Broughton, and Mary Luce.  We would like to thank all of them for helping create this fascinating exhibit. The Dayton Historic Depot is located at 222 E. Commercial Ave, in Dayton, WA, and is open from 11: 00 a.m. to 4: 00 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday.  We hope you come visit us soon!",

This year, we will be sharing women’s clothing from the Depot’s Collection and from the Boldman House Collection.  The clothing is organized by time period, and is accompanied by foundation garments, hats, and purses, as well.  The exhibit provides some cultural information on each decade and a discussion on how the fashion changed during that time period.  As women’s roles transformed, their clothing necessarily did as well.The exhibit has been funded by grants from the Warren Foundation and the Pacific Power Foundation.  Additional artifacts have been loaned to us by Lorna Barth, Sylvia Beuhler, Christine Broughton, and Mary Luce.  We would like to thank all of them for helping create this fascinating exhibit. The Dayton Historic Depot is located at 222 E. Commercial Ave, in Dayton, WA, and is open from 11: 00 a.m. to 4: 00 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday.  We hope you come visit us soon!",

This year, we will be sharing women’s clothing from the Depot’s Collection and from the Boldman House Collection.  The clothing is organized by time period, and is accompanied by foundation garments, hats, and purses, as well.  The exhibit provides some cultural information on each decade and a discussion on how the fashion changed during that time period.  As women’s roles transformed, their clothing necessarily did as well.The exhibit has been funded by grants from the Warren Foundation and the Pacific Power Foundation.  Additional artifacts have been loaned to us by Lorna Barth, Sylvia Beuhler, Christine Broughton, and Mary Luce.  We would like to thank all of them for helping create this fascinating exhibit.
